# Restaurant Order App

## Overview
This project is a simulation of a food ordering application for a restaurant. The app allows users to browse dishes, add items to the cart, modify quantities, and remove items from the cart. It demonstrates the functionality of a modern food ordering app and uses Redux for state management.

## Features
- **Add Items to Cart**: Users can select dishes and add them to the shopping cart.
- **Modify Quantities**: Adjust the quantity of items.
- **Remove Items**: Remove individual items from the cart.
- **State Management with Redux**: The app uses Redux to manage the application's state efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Redux**: For managing the application's state.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For simplifying Redux implementation.
- **CSS**: For styling the components.

## How It Works
1. **Browse Dishes**: Users can view a list of available dishes.
2. **Add to Cart**: Clicking the "Add to Cart" button adds a selected dish to the cart with a default quantity of 1.
3. **Modify Quantities**: Users can increase or decrease the quantity of any item.
4. **Remove from Cart**: Users can remove items from the cart with a single click.
